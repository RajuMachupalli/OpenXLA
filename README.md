**OpenXLA**: It is an open-source machine learning compiler that can optimize models from different frameworks for various hardware platforms.
**StableHLO**: StableHLO is an operation set for high-level operations (HLO) in machine learning (ML) models. It's a portability layer between different ML frameworks and ML compilers: ML frameworks that produce StableHLO programs are compatible with ML compilers that consume StableHLO programs. StableHLO is based on the MHLO dialect and enhances it with additional functionality.

**MHLO**:
